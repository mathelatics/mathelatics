# Mathelatics : Foundation of Applied Mathematics
### Hi friends,
  **My name is Ajeet Kumar Bhardwaj and a student of Applied Mathematics. It is driven by finding the solution to the real world problems using the mathematical tools and techniques from Pure Mathematics. Thus, 
  Applied and Pure Mathematics are Interelated becouse of thier capability to solve the problems with the idea of superposition. with this lots of concepts, techniques, equations, laws and functions etc are developed in applied mathematics
  for solving the real world problems from different areas like Operational Research, Mathematical Optimization, Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Signal Processing, Dynamical Systems and Data Driven Sciences etc. Solving any Real World Problem, 
  We needed to identify the Paradigm like Procedural, Concurrent, Modular etc to get the desired results for this we use a technique called mathematical modeling. But today's there are other techniques developed which are data driven like 
  machine learning and deep learning for dynamical systems etc.**
